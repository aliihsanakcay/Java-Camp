## Book Sorter 

Design a class called Book. Implement this class from Comparable interface and override the "compareTo" method. Inside this method, write the code that sorts the book by name from A to Z. Then use a data structure of the Set type a second time and have it sort the books by the number of pages. 

The Book class consists of the name of the book, the number of pages, the name of the author, and the date of publication.
